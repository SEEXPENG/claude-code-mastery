## How to Start

1. **Pick a project** that solves a real problem for you
2. **Tell me what you want** (don't specify how to do it)
3. **Watch what I do** and ask questions
4. **Use the result** in your real work
5. **Move to the next project**

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with What You Need
Don't build fake projects. Build something you'll actually use.

### Tip 2: Let Me Drive
Describe the outcome, not the steps. Trust me to choose the right approach.

### Tip 3: Ask "Why" Not "How"
Instead of "How do I X?", ask "Why did you choose Y?"

### Tip 4: Iterate
Start simple, add features progressively. Don't try to build everything at once.

### Tip 5: Learn from My Approach
Pay attention to:
- Which tools I use when
- How I structure the work
- When I use agents
- How I verify success
