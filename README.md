## Learning Approach

This repository follows a **hands-on, project-based** approach:

1. **Read**: Understand the concepts in each phase's README
2. **Experiment**: Try the examples yourself
3. **Build**: Complete the practice projects
4. **Reflect**: Document what you learned
5. **Practice**: Apply it to your own projects

## Estimated Time

- **Total**: 2-3 weeks to mastery with consistent practice
- **Daily commitment**: 2-4 hours
- **Flexible**: Go at your own pace, skip familiar topics

## Resources

- [LEARNING_PATH.md](./LEARNING_PATH.md) - Day-by-day guide
- [CHEATSHEET.md](./CHEATSHEET.md) - Quick reference
- Claude Code CLI: Run `/help` for built-in documentation
